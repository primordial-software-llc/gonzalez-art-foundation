# Projector Care

## Warranty Project Bulb Lifetime
>>>>Two-Year Projector Limited Warranty and 90-Day Lamp Limited Warranty

From the specifications here: http://www.projectorreviews.com/epson/epson-home-cinema-1040-home-theater-projector-review-specifications-brochure/

>>>>Lamp Life: 5000 hours

2500 hours = 104 days
5000 hours = 208 days

The stated lamp life likely only applies to *eco-mode* and without *eco-mode* the lamp life is half that making sense of the 90 day lamp warranty.

### Burn Down
250000 images shown on a 30 second rotation.

7,500,000 seconds

125,000 minutes

2,083 hours

86 days

Based on the burn down analysis I'm going to likely kill the bulb by browsing the-athenaeum. I'm going to be watching movies as well, I mean how could I not with this kind of equipment, so the number should be doubled. I'm likely going to need a new bulb in 1-2 years with good care and relatively heavy usage.
